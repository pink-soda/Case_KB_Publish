Hi Jiawei,
我们希望能够有关此问题的积极更新。
此问题会影响接下来OEM联想在V2022-L的持续出货，根据影响的机型平台等情况分析有可能导致超过150k无法出货且将影响部分大客户（如：工行、招行等）的投标，还请尽快提供进一步的分析情况及解决方案。

邮件内容:
Hi Gaomeng，
Sophie在与PG team沟通后，PG team 仍然拒绝了修复此问题，拒绝原因如下：
*  问题复现概低  - only 15% repro rate; only occurs after reboot
*  当前有可行的workaround - disable Lenovo Intelligent sensing
*  Business Justification不够 – 此问题并不仅在CMGE发生，建议联想尝试通过OEM channel 直接升级到微软，以提高Business Justification
另外Sophie对此问题仍存在些疑问：
It seems that this is also not a regression and has existed in the code for some time. Did Lenovo not originally test the Intelligent Sense feature on Win10 21H2 and similar platforms with the same codebase (Win10 20H1 and beyond)?
If this issue is truly critical to Lenovo, why wouldn’t they be willing to directly engage with Microsoft? 
如果需要Sophie继续跟进此问题还需提供Sophie需要的信息。谢谢！
